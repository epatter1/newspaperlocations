Done - Parse the attached newspaper_locations.json file and make a list of all the locations.

Done - If the the locations'style is “paperbox” then make the background of the item equal to #2ECC71 (green) if the style of the location
is “starbucks” make the background #C0392B (red).

Done - Display the style, details and lat & long info for each location in the list.

Done - Display the text in #FFFFFF (white).

Done - Make the items clickable and display the map with the location of the item (centered with pin) when clicked.

The assumptions are:
Done - You will build an Android App (since you have Android experience)
Done -  In progress - No 3rd party libraries; use only native libraries
Done - The JSON file is to reside locally in the assets folder
Done - There is no time limit, but the sooner the better
Done - Code should be clear and commented when needed
TODO - Once you have completed coding and testing please send back the project in a zip file or send a github link. I should be able to import and build the project in my Android Studio IDE.
